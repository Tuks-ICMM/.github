    Welcome to the Institute for Cellular and Molecular Medicine
</h1>
<br>
<p align="left">
    The Institute for Cellular and Molecular Medicine keenly supports the University of Pretoria’s objective of improving the quality of scientific research and raising the research profile of the University at all levels.
</p>
<p align="left">
    The Institute has a solid research base in human health sciences and is entering into a phase of rapid growth as it responds to the heavy national and regional burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases. Several cross-cutting disciplines have been defined in an effort to focus the Institute’s activities. The disciplines concerned include genetics/genomics, cell-based therapy, the neurosciences, bio-entrepreneurship and the regulatory (legislative) environment.
